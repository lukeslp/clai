#PROJECT_PLAN FOR LLAMACLI
# PROJECT PLAN FOR LLAMACLI

## 1. Introduction
**llamacli** is a user-friendly command-line assistant built on top of a local Ollama model. It translates natural-language prompts into shell commands or Python snippets, executes them securely in the user’s environment, and formats the output for clarity.

## 2. Objectives
- Lower the barrier for non-expert users to perform common shell and Python tasks.
- Provide an interactive, guided experience with safety checks and confirmations.
- Offer extensible “cheat-sheet” shortcuts and wizard prompts for complex operations.
- Maintain a history of sessions for replay and learning.
- Support configuration overrides for model, endpoint, and behavior.

## 3. Core Feature Set
1. **Natural-Language to Code**  
   - Single-turn translation from English to `bash` or `python`.
2. **Interactive CLI Styling**  
   - Colorized prompts, banners, and output sections via Colorama.
3. **Configuration Management**  
   - Environment-variable and CLI-flag overrides for Ollama endpoint/model.
4. **Pretty Output**  
   - Automatic pretty-printing of JSON/dict outputs (e.g., `os.environ`).
5. **Cheat-Sheet Library**  
   - Predefined shortcuts for common tasks (disk usage, file search, process listing).
6. **Confirmation & Dry-Run**  
   - Preview of generated commands with user confirmation before execution.
7. **Session History & Replay**  
   - Persist prompts, commands, and outputs to `~/.llamacli/history`; support `replay` subcommand.
8. **Help & Wizard Mode**  
   - Step-by-step guided mode to build and refine commands interactively.
9. **Tab-Completion Support**  
   - Shell integration scripts for Bash/Zsh/Fish to complete subcommands and shortcuts.
10. **Startup Menu Display**  
   - On launch, show an interactive menu listing available commands (`help`, `cheats`, `model`, `quit`, etc.) and overrides.
11. **Single-Prompt Invocation**  
   - Accept a natural-language prompt as command-line arguments (`clai <prompt>`) to execute a single command and exit.

## 4. Phases & Milestones

| Phase    | Duration | Milestones & Deliverables                                                    |
|----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Phase 1 (MVP)** | 2 weeks  | - Core CLI scaffolding<br>- Natural‑language → code translation<br>- Basic execution engine<br>- Colorized prompts and output formatting<br>- Startup menu listing available CLI commands and overrides |
| **Phase 2**       | 3 weeks  | - Cheat‑sheet commands library<br>- Confirmation & dry‑run mode<br>- Config overrides via CLI flags and env vars<br>- Single-prompt CLI invocation |
| **Phase 3**       | 3 weeks  | - Session history & replay<br>- Wizard mode with contextual prompts<br>- Tab‑completion scripts |
| **Phase 4**       | 2 weeks  | - Explain mode & inline comments<br>- Error‑recovery suggestions<br>- Sandbox mode option |

## 5. Timeline
- **Week 1–2:** Phase 1 MVP  
- **Week 3–5:** Phase 2 feature completion  
- **Week 6–8:** Phase 3 enhancements  
- **Week 9–10:** Phase 4 polish, documentation, release

## 6. Success Metrics
- **Adoption:** 50+ installations in the first month.  
- **Engagement:** Average of 10 commands executed per user session.  
- **Error Rate:** < 5% parsing/execution failures.  
- **Satisfaction:** Positive feedback (4+ stars) in user surveys.

## 7. Resources & Roles
- **Developer:** Implement CLI features, tests, and documentation.  
- **Tester:** Validate prompts, confirm safety checks, and verify outputs.  
- **Documenter:** Write user guides, cheat-sheet references, and completion scripts.

## 8. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk                         | Mitigation                                      |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Incorrect command execution  | Require explicit confirmation, dry‑run option   |
| Model misinterpretation      | Provide templates and examples in system prompt |
| Shell injection / security   | Block unsafe tokens, sandbox mode               |
| Feature creep                | Strict phase gating and scope reviews           |

## 9. Next Steps
- Review and approve project plan.  
- Set up repository skeleton and CI pipeline.  
- Kick off Phase 1 development sprint.
