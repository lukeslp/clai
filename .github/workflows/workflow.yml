# GitHub Actions Workflow: Publish llamaline to PyPI via OIDC
#
# This workflow automates the process of building and publishing the llamaline package to PyPI
# whenever a new version tag (vX.Y.Z) is pushed to the repository. It uses OIDC for secure
# authentication, eliminating the need for a PyPI token in repository secrets.
#
# Accessibility & Maintenance Notes:
# - No user interaction required; fully automated.
# - All build and publish steps are logged in the Actions UI for transparency.
# - The workflow file is placed in .github/workflows/workflow.yml for discoverability.
# - Consider documenting this workflow in your README.md and CHANGELOG.md.
#
# Alternative: For more granular control, consider splitting build and publish into separate workflows.
